# Object-Detection-Fast-RCNN-Resnet50 in pytorch

We have a dataset including 200 images of one object which is a Racon (https://github.com/experiencor/raccoon_dataset)

We used Pretrained Fast RCNN with updated weights of COCO dataset 

For New dataset labeling (creating bounding box around object) you can use
